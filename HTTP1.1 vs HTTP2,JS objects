QUESTION 1
HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 are different versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. Here are the main differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

1. **Request and Response Multiplexing**: In HTTP/1.1, each request and response requires a separate connection, which can lead to inefficiencies, especially when multiple requests are made to the same server. HTTP/2 introduces request and response multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single connection. This multiplexing improves performance by reducing latency and eliminating the need for multiple connections.

2. **Binary Protocol**: While HTTP/1.1 uses a plain text format, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol for data transmission. The binary format allows for more efficient parsing and reduces the overhead of textual representation. This helps to improve performance by reducing the size of the data being transmitted.

3. **Header Compression**: HTTP/2 introduces header compression, which reduces the size of the headers sent between the client and the server. This compression technique, known as HPACK, reduces the amount of data transmitted, resulting in faster performance, especially for bandwidth-constrained connections.

4. **Server Push**: HTTP/2 includes a server push feature, which allows the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are explicitly requested. This can improve performance by reducing the number of round trips required to fetch all the necessary resources.

5. **Stream Prioritization**: HTTP/2 introduces the concept of stream prioritization, allowing the client to assign priority levels to different resources. This feature enables more efficient resource allocation and ensures that critical resources are loaded faster.

6. **Backward Compatibility**: HTTP/2 is designed to be fully backward compatible with HTTP/1.1. This means that servers that support HTTP/2 can still serve requests from clients using HTTP/1.1, providing a smooth transition without requiring immediate upgrades from all clients and servers.

QUESTION 2
Introduction:
In JavaScript, objects play a central role as they allow developers to create complex data structures and organize code efficiently. Understanding how objects are represented internally is essential for optimizing performance and leveraging the full power of the language. In this blog post, we'll dive into the internal representation of objects in JavaScript, exploring their key characteristics and highlighting important concepts along the way.

What are Objects in JavaScript?
Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, mutable data structures that store collections of key-value pairs. They serve as a fundamental building block for creating complex data models and encapsulating related functionality. In JavaScript, objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or classes.

Internal Representation of Objects:
Under the hood, objects in JavaScript are represented as key-value maps, where the keys are strings or symbols, and the values can be of any type, including other objects or functions. This representation is often referred to as a hash table or hash map.

Property Access and Lookup:
To access or modify properties of an object, JavaScript uses property accessors. When a property is accessed, the JavaScript engine performs a property lookup by searching for the key within the object's internal map. This lookup can either be direct or involve traversing the prototype chain if the property is not found directly on the object itself.

Property Descriptors:
Each property in JavaScript is associated with a property descriptor that defines various attributes such as whether the property is writable, enumerable, or configurable. Property descriptors provide fine-grained control over the behavior of object properties and can be manipulated using the `Object.defineProperty()` method.

Memory Management:
JavaScript objects are allocated memory dynamically, and memory management is handled automatically by the JavaScript engine's garbage collector. When an object is no longer reachable from the program, it becomes eligible for garbage collection, and its memory is reclaimed.

Object Identity and Equality:
In JavaScript, object comparison is based on reference equality. Two objects are considered equal if they reference the same memory location. However, when comparing the contents of two objects, a deep equality check is required, which involves comparing each key-value pair recursively.

Optimizing Object Access:
When working with objects in JavaScript, there are several techniques to optimize performance. Caching property access, avoiding unnecessary prototype chain traversal, and minimizing property lookups can significantly improve the execution speed of object-oriented code.

Object Serialization:
JavaScript objects can be serialized into various formats, such as JSON, which represents objects as strings. Serialization allows objects to be transmitted over the network or stored in a persistent manner. Conversely, deserialization is the process of reconstructing objects from serialized data.
